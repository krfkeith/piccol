The Piccol programming language
===============================

Piccol is programming language that is

  * Embeddable and small
  * Statically-typed and strict
  * Purely functional
  * Very easy to extend and modify

It is a language in the spirit of Lua, Tcl and Scheme, only on the other end of the strictness scale, inspired by
Standard ML, C++ and Haskell.
